title: Why I need an island
---

I've come across advice to blog from experienced Data Scientists more times than I care to remember. The advice is mainly for new entrants to the field - to help them set up a portfolio that can be used to attract or showcase their skilset to potential employers. Fortunately for me, my first employers took a chance on me and I didn't need to put in a lot of effort just setting up a newcomer portfolio. In the recent months, I've recognised a lesser know need for a semi-professional blog: as an outlet to prevent me from being an insufferable ass in public! In the last few months of consulting, I've had the incredible opportunity to get paid while I explore new tools and techniques. As a result, I'm like the hyper-excited child shouting 'Look at this awesome!!!".

A more serious reason is one that I read about last week in Srinivas Rao's book 'An Audience of One'. In this book, he explores the thesis of producing work for oneself. While publishing a blog on the publicly accessible interwebs might seem an ironic salute to the lofty aim of 'producing for oneself', the reality is that blogs are often internet islands inhabited only by their creator. But the very possibility of someone else getting stranded on my little cyber-island (even for a short while) is enough to make me take the professionalism notch to the next level. There is a reason my paper journal is safely guarded while the blog will not be! 

This little island will contain diverse flora and fauna; from spatial analysis monsters to Bayesian flowers. Despite my claims of being a Data Scientist, I cannot predict the future with any great accuracy. But if I were to use a Markovian process, I say that future posts will be similar to my first set of data science posts: mostly on spatial analyses. This reflects my growing fascination towards urban planning - especially in developing countries.
