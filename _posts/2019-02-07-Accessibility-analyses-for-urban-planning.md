title: Using accessibility analyses to understand walkability in Wellington
---
In his recent book, Alain Bertuad beautifully lays out the value proposition of urban life:
> .. allowing for core indispensable values of urban life ..
- A commute short enough that one has time for leisure activities.
- An open job market that allows one to change jobs and - through trial and error - find a job that best suits.
- A residence from which access to social life or nature is quick and easy.

As a life-long urbanite with stints around the world, I have given deep thought to each of those points when evaluating a place to live - from the city itself to a suburb / area. I even moved back to New Zealand after a few years in the UK solely for #2 and #3! As I was looking for rental property, #1 and #3 were primary on my mind.

The above three points are typical core values for _individuals_. #3 for individuals in a family would grow to include other amenities like schools, medical services and retail. Metrics like the NDAI (Neighbourhood Destination Accessibility Index) offer a comprehensive representation of #3.

As urbanites, we can transport ourselves to our amenity with some form of motorised transport like a car, bus train or even hired vehicles (a taxi or Uber). We can also use active transport like walking, cycling, running, skateboarding or scooting! Active transport has become particularly relevant in the current climes.

> Reducing car reliance and encouraging more transport-related physical activity are now recognised as beneficial objectives from health, social and environmental perspectives. Evidence is accumulating that a number of built environment attributes are associated with the likelihood of residents using active transport.

The above quote from a [research paper published by Knowledge Auckland](http://knowledgeauckland.org.nz/assets/publications/Measuring_Neighbourhood_Walkability_in_New_Zealand_Cities.pdf) succinctly summarises the connection between transport, physical activity and the built urban environment. In this series, I'll be restricting the analyses to walking - rather than a comprehensive view of active transport.

Walkability is a measure of how conducive an area is for walking. This concept is getting increasing traction in diverse domains - from public health to urban planning - since walking is a healthy physical activity that also has economic, social and environmental advantages.

Urban attributes are critical for understanding if people will substitute automobile transport (particularly the car) for active transport.

> Valid and reliable measures of these urban attributes are critical to improving our understanding of the relationship between the built environment and transport mode use.

In economics terms, behavioural characteristics (of the actor) and the nature of critical urban attributes will determine the opportunity cost of walking to the required amenity - from a visit to the local grocery store, to commuting for work.

Setting aside the wide spectrum of inclinations and behavioural characteristics, we can focus on the more tractable attributes associated with walking to an amenity. To simplify _even further_, let's consider walking to the local playground.
